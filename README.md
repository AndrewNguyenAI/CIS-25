Module 8 - Bank Account Simulation

BankAccount.cpp
-------

This program creates a simple BankAccount class that tracks the user's balance. 
It includes functions for depositing money, making purchases, displaying the current balance, 
and saving each transaction to a text file.

The main function performs an initial deposit, makes several purchases, adds another deposit, 
prints the final balance, and writes all actions to transactions.txt.

transactions.txt
-------

This file is automatically created and updated when the program runs.
Each deposit and purchase is recorded as a separate line to show the transaction history.
