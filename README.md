Module 8 - Bank Account Simulation

BankAccount.cpp
-------

This program creates a BankAccount class that keeps track of the user's money.
It lets the user deposit money, make purchases, see the current balance, 
and save each transaction to a text file.

The main function makes a starting deposit, does several purchases, makes another deposit,
shows the final balance, and writes all actions to transactions.txt.

transactions.txt
-------

This file is automatically created and updated when the program runs.
Each deposit and purchase is recorded as a separate line to show the transaction history.
